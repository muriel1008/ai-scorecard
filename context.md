## Three Proficiency Tiers

| Tier | Score | Audience % | Profile |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| AI Curious | 12-19 | ~70% | Dabbler, no system |

| AI Native | 29-36 | ~5% | Power user, built systems |

## Workshop Core Message

- **Problem:** 80% abandon AI training after 3 weeks because training focuses on Prompting instead of Management/Judgment layer
- **Solution:** "AI as a Manager" mindset, not just technical prompting
- **Three Frameworks:** Prompting for programming thinking, Tool Chaining (Perplexity → Claude → Gamma), Agent Mindset (AI as employee)
